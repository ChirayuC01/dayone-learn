# DayOne Learn

A gamified, multi-course daily learning platform. Each course is written day by day in Notion, and a scheduled Claude job pushes each new lesson and quiz into this app through the ingest API (see `NEW_COURSE_PLAYBOOK.md`).

Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router) · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS v4 · PostgreSQL + Prisma 6 · Auth.js v5 · Zod · Vitest · Playwright.

## Local setup

Requires Node ≥ 22.18 for local development (the seed script runs TypeScript directly with Node's built-in type stripping) and PostgreSQL 14+.

```bash
cp .env.example .env            # then edit DATABASE_URL if needed
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev          # create tables
npm run db:seed                 # load reference/seed/* (idempotent; safe to re-run)
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` / `build` / `start` | Next.js |
| `npm run lint` · `typecheck` · `test` | ESLint · `tsc --noEmit` · Vitest |
| `npm run db:migrate` | `prisma migrate dev` |
| `npm run db:deploy` | `prisma migrate deploy` (production) |
| `npm run db:seed [slug]` | Load `reference/seed/<slug>/` (all courses if omitted) |
| `npm run db:reset` | Drop and recreate the database (then run `db:seed`) |

## Layout

```
app/                  Next.js routes (React Server Components by default)
lib/                  business rules as pure, unit-tested functions, plus DB services
  ingest/             schema.ts (Zod) · normalize.ts (pure rules) · service.ts (transactional upserts)
  content/            outline.ts (titles, tracks, syllabus states) · theme.ts (per-course accent) · queries.ts
  markdown/           remark-details.ts (the only raw HTML allowed in lessons: <details>/<summary>)
components/           Markdown renderer, reader sidebar/drawer, track toggle, cards
prisma/               schema.prisma and migrations
scripts/seed.ts       loads reference/seed/ through lib/ingest/service.ts (the same code the API uses)
reference/            prototype.html (design system source) and seed content
```

Code under `lib/` that scripts import uses relative imports with explicit `.ts` extensions and receives its Prisma client as an argument, so plain Node can run it without a bundler.

## Pages (so far)

| Route | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing: catalogue and how it works |
| `/courses` | Catalogue cards (accent, icon, days published, learners) |
| `/courses/[slug]` | Overview, track picker, syllabus by module (published / upcoming) |
| `/learn/[slug]/day/[nn]` | Lesson reader with sidebar, track toggle, module-test card on review days, pager |
| `/learn/[slug]/module/[n]` | Module test page (questions arrive in phase 4) |

Lesson Markdown is rendered on the server with GFM and `rehype-sanitize`. ` ```bash ` blocks get a `$` prompt per command line and a copy button, ` ```output ` blocks a dashed box, and any other fence a diagram box. Raw HTML is dropped except `<details>`/`<summary>`. Until sign-in exists, the chosen track is stored in a per-course cookie.

## Seed data format

`reference/seed/<slug>/course.json` is the body of `PUT /api/ingest/courses/<slug>`, `day-NN.json` the body of `PUT …/lessons/NN`, and `module-N.json` the body of `PUT …/modules/N`. Presentation fields the export doesn't carry (accent, icon, description, status) are filled from `COURSE_DEFAULTS` in `scripts/seed.ts`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, typecheck, unit tests and a production build on Node 20. A second job applies the migrations to Postgres 16, checks that `schema.prisma` and the migrations are in sync, and runs the seed twice to prove it's idempotent.
